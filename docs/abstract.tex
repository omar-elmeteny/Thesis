Language poses a significant barrier to teaching programming to children in non-English speaking countries. This project aims to address this challenge by creating an Eclipse Plugin that enables the localization of source code. With the developed plugin, users can define keywords and reserved words of a specific programming language in their own language. In this project, Java will be the localized programming language. Consequently, children from different cultures, such as an Egyptian child using Arabic or a German child using German, can write programs in their native language. This paper shows how I used scanners, parsers, code generators, and transpilers as well as build automation tools to achieve language localization. Through this project, the aim is to remove the language barrier and create an inclusive programming learning environment for children worldwide.
