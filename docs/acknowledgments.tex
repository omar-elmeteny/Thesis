This project wouldn't have been done without the assistance and support of many people. First and foremost, thanks to God almighty for everything I have and know. Next, I would like to thank Dr. Wael Abouelsaadat for guiding me throughout the semester and giving me constructive feedback that helped in improving the project. I would like to thank all my teachers and instructors at school and university who generously shared their knowledge with me. Finally, I would like to thank my parents, brother, and friends for always supporting me whenever I needed them which gave me more motivation and confidence.
